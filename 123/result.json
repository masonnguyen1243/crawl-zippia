In general, a vice president or a VP is the leader of a company or department who servers under the president, CEO, or chairperson. Becoming a vice president and manager is one of the most prestigious, sustainable, and profitable roles, which offers you an opportunity to communicate your ideas clearly and present new concepts or directions for your company's growth. Following behind the president and CEO, you'll be in charge of all business operations, decisions, and ventures. Vice president is a role that requires you to use your leadership and decision-making skills to develop and implement successful business strategies, provide management, oversight, and demonstrate a commitment to excellence all the time. Working as a VP, you'll usually be second or third in command and collaborate with the senior leadership of your company by overseeing the internal operations, but may step in the president's place when he/she is unavailable.",
